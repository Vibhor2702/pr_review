## üîß Essential Environment Variables

### Railway (Backend)
```bash
GEMINI_API_KEY=your_gemini_api_key_here  # REQUIRED
PORT=8080                                 # Auto-set by Railway
FLASK_ENV=production                      # Recommended
```

### Cloudflare Pages (Frontend)
```bash
VITE_API_URL=https://pr-review-production.up.railway.app  # REQUIRED
```

## üîó Live URLs Template

Once deployed, your URLs will be:

```
Frontend: https://pr-review.pages.dev
Backend:  https://pr-review-production.up.railway.app
Health:   https://pr-review-production.up.railway.app/health
API Docs: https://pr-review-production.up.railway.app/
```

---

## üß™ Quick Test Commands

### Test Backend
```bash
# Health check
curl https://pr-review-production.up.railway.app/health

# API information
curl https://pr-review-production.up.railway.app/

# Demo review
curl -X POST https://pr-review-production.up.railway.app/demo/review \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"provider":"github","owner":"test","repo":"demo","pr_number":1}'
```

### Test Frontend
1. Open: https://pr-review.pages.dev
2. Open DevTools (F12) ‚Üí Console
3. Check for errors (should be none)
4. Try demo mode
5. Try real PR review

## üêõ Quick Troubleshooting

### Backend Issues
| Problem | Solution |
|---------|----------|
| 500 Error | Check Railway logs, verify `GEMINI_API_KEY` is set |
| App not starting | Check `railway.json` and `Procfile` are committed |
| Slow first request | Railway free tier sleeps after inactivity (~30s wake) |

### Frontend Issues
| Problem | Solution |
|---------|----------|
| CORS errors | Verify `VITE_API_URL` in Cloudflare matches Railway URL |
| Build fails | Check `package.json` and build command in Cloudflare |
| Blank page | Check browser console for errors, verify dist/ built |

### Integration Issues
| Problem | Solution |
|---------|----------|
| API calls fail | Verify CORS settings in `src/server.py` |
| 404 on API | Check Railway URL is correct in Cloudflare env vars |
| Mixed content | Ensure both URLs use HTTPS |

## üí° Pro Tips

1. **Test Locally First**: Run frontend and backend locally before deploying
2. **Check Logs**: Always check deployment logs for errors
3. **Environment Variables**: Double-check spelling and values
4. **CORS**: Ensure backend allows frontend domain
5. **API URL**: Make sure frontend has correct backend URL
6. **Cache**: Clear browser cache if changes don't appear
7. **Railway Sleep**: First request may be slow (wakes from sleep)
8. **Gemini API**: Verify your Gemini API key is active
