# 🔍 How PR Review Works - Real Data Flow

## 🎯 Overview

Your PR Review system now fetches **real pull request data** from GitHub and analyzes it using **Google Gemini AI** through your Cloudflare Workers backend.

## 📊 Complete Data Flow

```
User Input → GitHub API → Cloudflare Workers → Gemini AI → Frontend Display

## 🔑 API Key Configuration

### ✅ Development (Local)
- **Location**: `workers/.dev.vars` (gitignored)
- **Key**: `GEMINI_API_KEY=AIzaSyAi9gBbbfZDRqQdUxV4sOFhSd3fphT8Hig`
- **Usage**: Automatically loaded when running `npm run dev`

### 🚀 Production (Cloudflare)
When you deploy to production:
```bash
cd workers
npx wrangler secret put GEMINI_API_KEY
# Enter your key when prompted
```

This stores your key **securely** in Cloudflare's encrypted environment.

## 🔄 Step-by-Step Process

### 1️⃣ User Submits PR
Frontend form (`NewReviewModal.tsx`):
- Provider: `github`
- Owner: `microsoft`
- Repo: `vscode`
- PR Number: `12345`

### 2️⃣ Fetch Real PR Data
```typescript
// Call GitHub API
const prData = await fetch(
  `https://api.github.com/repos/${owner}/${repo}/pulls/${pr_number}`
)

// Get PR metadata: title, author, changed_files, refs
// Get PR diff from: prData.diff_url
```

**What We Get:**
- PR title and description
- Author username
- Files changed count
- Branch names (head/base)
- **Complete code diff** (additions/deletions)

### 3️⃣ Send to Cloudflare Workers
```typescript
POST /api/review
{
  "diff": "--- a/file.js\n+++ b/file.js\n...",
  "repo": "microsoft/vscode",
  "author": "username",
  "pr_number": 12345,
  "title": "Add new feature",
  "description": "This PR adds..."
}
```

### 4️⃣ Workers Processes Request
Backend (`workers/src/index.ts`):
1. Validates required fields
2. Constructs detailed prompt for Gemini
3. Calls Google Gemini 1.5 Flash API
4. Parses AI response into structured format

### 5️⃣ Gemini AI Analysis
Gemini evaluates:
- ✅ **Code Quality**: readability, maintainability, best practices
- 🔒 **Security**: vulnerabilities, input validation
- ⚡ **Performance**: efficiency, optimization opportunities
- 🧪 **Testing**: coverage, edge cases
- 📝 **Documentation**: comments, clarity

Returns:
- **Score** (0-100)
- **Grade** (A+, A, B+, B, C+, C, D, F)
- **Summary** (2-3 sentence assessment)
- **Suggestions** (specific actionable improvements)
- **Severity Breakdown** (critical/high/medium/low issue counts)

### 6️⃣ Frontend Displays Results
Transformed response shows:
- Score badge with color coding
- Grade letter (A-F)
- PR context (repo, author, files changed)
- AI-generated summary
- List of suggestions for improvement
- Severity breakdown chart

## 🔐 Security: Why Keys Are Safe

### ❌ What We Removed
`.env.example` had **real keys** that would be committed to GitHub:
```bash
GEMINI_API_KEY=AIzaSyAi9gBbbfZDRqQdUxV4sOFhSd3fphT8Hig  # EXPOSED!
```

### ✅ What We Fixed
1. **Local Development**: Keys in `workers/.dev.vars` (gitignored)
2. **Production**: Keys stored in Cloudflare Secrets (encrypted)
3. **Example File**: Only placeholders in `.env.example`

## 🆚 Demo vs Real Data

| Aspect | Before (Demo) | After (Real) |
|--------|--------------|--------------|
| PR Data | Hardcoded mock | GitHub API |
| Diff Content | Fake examples | Actual code changes |
| AI Analysis | N/A | Google Gemini |
| Results | Static mock | Dynamic AI review |
| Accuracy | 0% | Real code analysis |

## 🚀 Testing Real Reviews

### 1. Start Local Dev Server
```bash
cd workers
npm run dev
# Server runs at http://localhost:8787
```

### 2. Test with Real PR
Try this real PR:
- Owner: `microsoft`
- Repo: `vscode`
- PR Number: `200000` (or any valid number)

### 3. Watch the Flow
Check console logs to see:
1. ✅ GitHub API call for PR data
2. ✅ Diff fetch from GitHub
3. ✅ POST request to `/api/review`
4. ✅ Gemini AI analysis
5. ✅ Results displayed

## 📝 Removed Files

All Railway deployment files deleted:
- ❌ `railway.json` - Railway config
- ❌ `railway.toml` - Railway settings
- ❌ `.railwayignore` - Railway ignore file
- ❌ `Procfile` - Railway start command
- ❌ `runtime.txt` - Python version (not needed)
- ❌ `nixpacks.toml` - Railway build config
- ❌ `.env.railway` - Railway environment

**Why?** You're using Cloudflare Workers (serverless) now, not Railway!

## 💡 Key Differences

### Cloudflare Workers (Current)
- ✅ **Forever free** (100K requests/day)
- ✅ **Global edge network** (fast everywhere)
- ✅ **Serverless** (no servers to manage)
- ✅ **Instant cold starts** (<50ms)
- ✅ **Built-in HTTPS**

### Railway (Removed)
- ❌ Free tier sleeps after inactivity
- ❌ Single region deployment
- ❌ Server-based (requires maintenance)
- ❌ Slow cold starts (~30 seconds)
- ❌ Credit card eventually required

## 🎯 Next Steps

1. **Test Locally**: Run `npm run dev` in `workers/` directory
2. **Try Real PRs**: Use the frontend to analyze actual GitHub PRs
3. **Deploy Production**: Follow `DEPLOY.md` to deploy Workers + Pages
4. **Monitor Usage**: Check Cloudflare dashboard for request stats

---

**Your Gemini key is safe** in `workers/.dev.vars` (local) and will be in Cloudflare Secrets (production). The system now fetches **real PR data** and performs **actual AI analysis** instead of showing mock results! 🎉
